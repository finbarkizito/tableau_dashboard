## Project Components (Click to Explore)

Each component below links to a dedicated Markdown file explaining the **analytical approach, KPIs, and insights** behind the visuals.

- 📈 **[Sales Dashboard – Performance & Trends](sales/sales_dashboard.md)**
- 👥 **[Customer Dashboard – Behaviour & Value](customers/customer-dasboard.md)**
- 📊 **[Customer Distribution by Number of Orders](PLACEHOLDER_customer_distribution.md)**
- 🏆 **[Top Ten Customers Analysis](PLACEHOLDER_top_ten_customers.md)**
---

## Analytical Framework
All dashboards are driven by **Year-over-Year (YoY) analysis**, allowing users to dynamically select any year as the “current” year and compare performance against the previous year.

The analysis follows a consistent **Dimensions vs Measures** framework to ensure:
- Correct aggregation
- Analytical clarity
- Scalability across dashboards
