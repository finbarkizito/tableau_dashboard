# Tableau Sales & Customer Analytics Dashboard

> 📊 **Interactive business intelligence dashboards built in Tableau with a strong focus on analytical design, interactivity, and user experience.**

---

## Project Overview
This project delivers an **end-to-end Tableau analytics solution** developed to support business stakeholders with clear, actionable insight. The work spans **requirements definition, KPI design, analytical logic, interactivity, and user-focused dashboard design**, ensuring the final output is both decision-ready and scalable..

The solution consists of two integrated dashboards:
- **Sales Dashboard**
- **Customer Dashboard**

Both dashboards are driven by **Year-over-Year (YoY) analysis**, allowing users to dynamically select any year as the “current” year and compare performance against the previous year.
